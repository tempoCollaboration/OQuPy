This open source project aims to facilitate versatile numerical tools to efficiently compute the dynamics of quantum systems that are possibly strongly coupled to structured environments. It allows to conveniently apply the so called time evolving matrix product operator method (TEMPO) [1], as well as the process tensor TEMPO method (PT-TEMPO) [2]. An extension to the methods described in [3] and [4] are work in progress and supported by the [unitary fund](http://unitary.fund).
