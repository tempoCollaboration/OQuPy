This needs to be calculated which is shown below. The middle term is the derivative of the final state with respect to the system propagators. This is the computationally difficult part that is performed by the adjoint method. Finally the first term is the derivative of the objective function with respect to the final state, which we will later show that in the case of fidelity between a pure target state $|\\sigma\\rangle$ and $\\rho_f$, reduces to simply $\\sigma^T$, but more generally this will also need to be calculated.\n",
