This is the computationally difficult part that is performed by the adjoint method. Finally the first term is the derivative of the objective function with respect to the final state, which we will later show that in the case of fidelity between a pure target state $|\\sigma\\rangle$ and $\\rho_f$, reduces to simply $\\sigma^T$, but more generally this will also need to be calculated.\n",

    "Once the `oqupy.GradientDynamics` object has been created and the adjoint method has been used to get $\\frac{\\partial \\rho_f}{\\partial U_n}$ for all $n$, we can reuse the object for a different set of $\\frac{\\partial U_n}{\\partial c_k}$ without having to redo the entire adjoint calculation. By simply passing the previously outputted `gradient` object back into `oqupy.gradient()`, it automatically takes its result and we no longer need to specify the initial and target state as they have already been given, we just need to give the `dprop_dpram_list` and times"
